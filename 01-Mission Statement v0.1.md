## Mission Statement:

Create a platform for the future **Visitation, Exploration, & Settlement (VES) of Mars** by Crowd-Sourcing a Stem-to-Stern Plan, leveraging public domain records, Open Source Technology, and the spare-time of students, enthusiasts, academics, professionals, and retirees. We seek to establish and maintain a rising platform, upon which all can stand, so that **no Mars Mission is less than successful** but also that so many more can exceed expectations. If the public raises the low-bar everyone will go higher!
