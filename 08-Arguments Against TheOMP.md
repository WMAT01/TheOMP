Arguments Against TOMP:


1) Mars isn’t prized destination now.
	-Later will be too late.
	-Success takes time.
	-This can not wait, from our opinion.

2) We didn’t do anything with the Moon, so Mars is boring, and we’ll never leave this rock we call Earth:
	-The moon is chemically less interesting & less probably to sustain life.
	-We should have done more with the excitement around the moon landing but
	geopolitics and laziness got in the way.
	-

3)

4) None of my formal training is in the main fields of this project or my my degree is incomplete:
	- You can always participate by Questioning! Fresh eyes always sharpen the tool.
	- You will be surprised where you may be able to contribute: Law, Psychology, Finance, A/V Production, etc…
	- Work is peer reviewed, so “correct” submissions

5) But I’m a ____, with degrees in_____ and certified in ______, with ties in my profession that would look down on the idea of my participation:
	- You can use an avatar and blur your resume to make a contribution
	- As an up and comer, it could be advantageous to showcase a body of work from this project
	- Eventually, it will be encouraged to work on this project, as its threat to earning-potential recedes.


6) What if a “bad actor”, in Geo-Political terms, gains an advantage in going to Mars?
	- Then the self-perceived “Good Actors” have some work to do.
	- Also, Mars is far, so your enemies traveling far away could be good.

7) This project is crazy ambitious… as in, you are crazy:
	- Open-Source hardware/everything is emerging
	- It will happen eventually, and any successful launch is a victory
	- Sovereign Space Entities Move too slow
	-



8) What is with the management structure?
	- The best and most credible will rise to the top, managerially.
	-
9) The Hubris of this project is astounding.
	- Yes, join us.
	- Get your name on the moon by becoming a Contributor.

10) There is no Mars race
	- Let’s make one.




Extra:
0.1.A) What about a trip to Europa, Jupiter’s awesome moon with frozen water, and possibly LIFE!?!?!
	- If we don’t make it to Mars, we’ll never go as far as Europa.
	- Everything we learn about a trip to Mars will help a trip to Europa.
	- You could Found The Open Europa Project by forking this project, under the TOMPL, of course.
