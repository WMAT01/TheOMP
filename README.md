# The Open Mars Project
###### “If the public raises the low-bar, everyone will go higher!” -TOMP, July 1, 2013

=========

## Our 21st Century Opportunity:

### Mars…
	⁃	is the next destination for a field that yields incredible research dividends.
	⁃	is our best chance to spread humanity in to space, for at least the next century.
	⁃	is not the Moon, and will have strategic value for countries, multi-national corporations, and research institutions.

### Mars-One, SpaceX, etc…
	⁃	is bold but What about Mars-Two? Mars-Three? Mars-Year2149?
	⁃	may not be the best approach… or even close. What would you improve?
	⁃	will teach us lessons which should be learned ASAP, no matter what.

### The Open Source Movement…
	⁃	proves that spare time of brilliance can be harnessed successfully.
	⁃	shows that complexity is no enemy of world-wide collaboration.
	⁃	demonstrates that public-private cooperation can be mutually-beneficial.

## 01-Mission Statement:

Create a platform for the future **Visitation, Exploration, & Settlement (VES) of Mars** by Crowd-Sourcing a Stem-to-Stern Plan, leveraging public domain records, Open Source Technology, and the spare-time of students, enthusiasts, academics, professionals, and retirees. We seek to establish and maintain a rising platform, upon which all can stand, so that **no Mars Mission is less than successful** but also that so many more can exceed expectations. If the public raises the low-bar everyone will go higher!

===============

## 02-The Founding Principles:

	1)	**Licensing Is Important** (despite wanting to concentrate on the meat of the problem, this is potentially crippling, so):
	2)	Research Sourced from the Public Domain (is a start, which birthed a)
	3)	Multi-Pronged Licensing-Compliance Approach (meaning parallel approaches along a continuum from proverbial Off-The-Shelf Parts to Free-As-in-Beer components you build for the project, and points in between. Thus...).
	4)	All Open-Source Tools, Formats, & Platforms (so anyone can try to contribute, because)
	5)	Every Part of the Project is Important (no matter how un-technical or trivial it seems, because)
	6)	Failure is In the Details (in that no-one wants to travel 55 million kilometers and figure out the botanists forgot what’s edible or there isn’t enough money to send the other modules, because of some other unforeseen error, so)
	7)	Hard Work Saves Lives (because it may be your children on a mission some day, where they use derivative technology).
	8)	Modularity in All Things: from TOMP Organization to The Product (but…)
	9)	When in Doubt, Just Add Money… (meaning: always use Off-The-Shelf Parts to complete the design as opposed to not completing the design. For instance: NASA has will continue to use the RS-25 Engine so we assume that we will use it as well, as it will be a long time before an alternative can be built from scratch)
	10)	Use Forward- Thinking Technology: Today’s Emerging Technology is the next decade’s solid foundation, crumbling infrastructure, or vaporware. (with that said:)
	11)	C89 Can Run on Anything; We need shielded microprocessors; Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

===================




## 03-Vision Of Success (VOS v0.1 - Excerpt):

	1.)	The Product is a complete & copy-able plan, that demonstrate the best in:
	  ⁃	Materials, Design (CAD), Construction, Software
	  ⁃	AeroSpace, Nuclear, & Agricultural Engineering,
	  ⁃	AstroPhysics, Aeronautics, Chemistry, Geology
	  ⁃	Logistics, Government, Community Planning, Social Activism
	  ⁃	Marketing, A/V, Financing (crowd-funding)
	2.)	The First Product by July 1, 2015 (TOMP vXXXX.Q)
	3.)	The Product is a versioned and quarterly-updated document, needing only .
	4.)	A lowered Barrier of Entry for all space-related exploration.
	5.)	Vision Of Success (VOS v0.1 - Excerpt - cont.):
	6.)	A versioned, living-document that is a COMPLETE plan (Just Add Money!):
	  ⁃	Materials, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Construction, Software Engineering
	  ⁃	Logistics, Nuclear, & Agricultural Engineering,
	  ⁃	Nuclear Physics, Aeronautics, Astronomy, Geology
	  ⁃	Government, Community Planning, Social Activism
	  ⁃	Marketing, A/V, Financing (crowd-funding)
	7.)	The plan has complete, and
	8.)	A lowered Barrier of Entry for all space-related exploration.
