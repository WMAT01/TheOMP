## The Founding Principles:

	1)	**Licensing Is Important** (despite wanting to concentrate on the meat of the problem, this is potentially crippling, so):
	2)	Research Sourced from the Public Domain (is a start, which birthed a)
	3)	Multi-Pronged Licensing-Compliance Approach (meaning parallel approaches along a continuum from proverbial Off-The-Shelf Parts to Free-As-in-Beer components you build for the project, and points in between. Thus...).
	4)	All Open-Source Tools, Formats, & Platforms (so anyone can try to contribute, because)
	5)	Every Part of the Project is Important (no matter how un-technical or trivial it seems, because)
	6)	Failure is In the Details (in that no-one wants to travel 55 million kilometers and figure out the botanists forgot what’s edible or there isn’t enough money to send the other modules, because of some other unforeseen error, so)
	7)	Hard Work Saves Lives (because it may be your children on a mission some day, where they use derivative technology).
	8)	Modularity in All Things: from TOMP Organization to The Product (but…)
	9)	When in Doubt, Just Add Money… (meaning: always use Off-The-Shelf Parts to complete the design as opposed to not completing the design. For instance: NASA has will continue to use the RS-25 Engine so we assume that we will use it as well, as it will be a long time before an alternative can be built from scratch)
	10)	Use Forward- Thinking Technology: Today’s Emerging Technology is the next decade’s solid foundation, crumbling infrastructure, or vaporware. (with that said:)
	11)	C89 Can Run on Anything; We need shielded microprocessors; Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
