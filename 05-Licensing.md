## 04-Licensing

The initial approach to modularity:Licensing (v0.1):

**The Open Mars Project License (TOMPL)** is a forward-thinking, Open-ish License that encourages “forking,” asks for nothing up-front, and seeks to serve the best interests of the project.

**TOMP “Attribution for Contributors” (TOMPAC)** is a primary goal, with plans to properly honor (and memorialize) every Contributor. Also participation and contribution are strictly catalogued with the intent to eventually compensate contributors for any Intellectual Property Licensing (IPL), however incidental.

At the very least, any & every mission in to space with derivative work will be required to publish such and take steps to have the specific contributors acknowledged, as well as TOMP as a whole.

TOMPAC, in the next decades will be managed by the organization in a fair and non-restrictive way, but the imagination wonders… (A book with contributors name placed on Mars —> a Monument to the TOMP Participants —> Clone Me on Mars… use your imagination).

**TOMP’s Intentions in drafting the future TOMPL:**
* To use open source technology as much as possible while delineating the licensing & purchasing requirements of any proprietary technology. Including open-source projects by reference, where necessary.
* Our intent is that no individual or entity gain undue compensation or advantage as a result of the contribution of others.
* Our intent is not to furnish any named member with anything other than due-compensation, upon review of the Board of Governance, the Contributors, and the participants at large, should a 4/5ths vote be called.
* This is all very boring but will be settled soon.
